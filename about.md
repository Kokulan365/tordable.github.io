I work at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> as Staff Software Engineer, in the Seattle office. Before that, I worked at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, doing search relevance algorithms in Live Search (currently Bing). And before I stayed for a short time at <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com">McKinsey</a>, as a Business Analyst intern.

Also, I am enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Mathematics by the <a href="http://www.uva.es">University of Valladolid</a>. After completing my final examination in 2009 I started working in a doctoral thesis under the supervision of Antonio Campillo and José Ignacio Farrán.

I'm interested in a wide variety of topics within Computer Science, Mathematics, Technology and Design. I regularly talk about these topics in my blog. I also enjoy classical literature, movies, flamenco music and videogames.
