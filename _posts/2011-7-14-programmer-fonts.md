<p>
I read a few days ago an interesting post about what are the best
fonts for programmers (monospaced fonts) at
<a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts/">
  Hivelogic</a>. And I decided to try out one of the fonts,
<a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">
  Inconsolata</a>. Here you have a screenshot of emacs with it.
</p>

I think it looks very similar to my previous favorite, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucida">Lucida Console</a>.
If you want to set it up in emacs (why would you use any other editor?),
just edit your .emacs file and add 
</p>

<pre>
(set-default-font "Inconsolata-12")
</pre>

<p>
Or something along those lines, depending on your preferred font size.
