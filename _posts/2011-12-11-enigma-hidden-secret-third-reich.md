title: Enigma, the Hidden Secret of the Third Reich

Cryptography studies how to process data to transmit it securely, even if
someone access the information in transit. For thousands of years
cryptography has been a key military technology. For example,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Julius Caesar</a>
used a simple encryption technique to communicate with his generals.
Starting from a message text, the method replaces a letter for another
letter in the alphabet that comes after one or several positions.
For example, if the secret message is:
</p>

```
HI THIS IS A SECRET MESSAGE
```

To encrypt, we can replace each letter with the next letter in the alphabet H->I, I->J and so on:

```
IJ UIJT JT B TFDSFU NFTTBHF
```

To decrypt, replace with the previous letter, I->H, J->I, etc.:

```
HI THIS IS A SECRET MESSAGE
```

<p>
The reason to use encryption is obvious. Imagine yourself two thousand
years ago. There is no telephone, internet, radio or anything similar.
You are trying to attack an enemy army and in order to do that, you have
split your forces into two, trying to enclose the enemy and force them to
surrender. Now, you need to synchronize with the other side of the army so
that you attack at the same time. But, if you simply send a soldier across
with a message like <em>Attack at dawn</em> you have the risk that the
soldier will be caught by the enemy army while trying to reach across.
If the enemy is able to read this message they could as well maneuver
during the night to escape the attack.
</p>

Here is where cryptography comes into play. If instead of sending a
message like
<em>Attack at dawn</em> you send an encrypted message, for example:
<em>BUUBDL BU EBXO</em> now it's not obvious what the message means.
Using a code secure enough so that only you and the recipient of the
message are able to understand it, means that you don't need to worry about
the enemy reading the message. For example, you could send three soldiers across different paths, and even if the enemy captures one of them,
the attack could proceed as planned.

One of the most famous cryptographic mechanisms in history is the system
used by German troops during World War II, the <em>Enigma</em>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_(machine)">Enigma</a>
is a family of machines that encrypt and decrypt messages based on
a complex set of electric and mechanical components.
</p>

<p>
The relevance of the Enigma comes from the fact that it provided
encryption that was vastly superior to most previous systems. It allowed
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat">U-Boat</a> submarines
from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reich">Third Reich</a>
to attack allied ships without any kind of warning.
The Enigma encryption was broken by allied cryptanalysts. It is often said
that this achievement <em>hastened the end of the European war by two
years</em>.

Recently I had the chance to see some of these Enigma machines in a visit
to Germany. They have some in display in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Museum">Deutsches
Museum</a> in Munich. I enjoyed the museum very much, and I highly
recommend it. If you are ever near Munich, the Deutsches Museum is
an obligated visit.
