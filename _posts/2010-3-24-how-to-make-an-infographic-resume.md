<p>
<strong>Infographics</strong>, or information graphics are visual
representations of data.
In a good visualization or representation of a data set, the author
expresses an idea that is deeper that the data itself. A good visualization
conveys a message that is clear and helps to extract conclusions, but
also a message that is precise and based on the data, without transforming
or manipulating the data in dishonest ways.
</p>


<p>
In the case of a <strong>resume</strong>, the data is obviously the
education, professional experience and interests of the candidate.
And the purpose of an <strong>infographic resume</strong>
is to show the greatest highlights of his or her education and
professional experience, to convince a potential employer of the
value of the candidate.
To do that, the charts and visualization
elements have to be adequate to the characteristics that we want
to remark. For example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a candidate has a lot of international professional experience,
    one way to show that is to include a world map with the location of
    the last work assignments
  </li>
  <li>
    Or if the candidate is a senior executive of a public corporation,
    it may be interesting to show the stock value of the company at
    the time that the executive launched new products, or took important
    business-wide decisions
  </li>
  <li>
    In case of a professor with a long publication history, it may be
    very valuable to show a chart of important publications and their
    citation index, as a measure of the impact of those publications in
    the scientific community
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Some Example Resumes</h3>

<p>
Over the last few years several designers have experimented with
inforgraphic resumes. Recently <strong>Randy Krum</strong> wrote a
post about it in his blog
<a href="http://www.coolinfographics.com/blog/2010/1/8/16-infographic-resumes-a-visual-trend.html">
  Cool Infographics</a>.
I am not going to repeat what he said, but I will mention a few
of the most famous ones.
</p>

<p>
The resume of <strong>Michael Anderson</strong> is probably the most
cited one, it includes a timeline with education and experience, and marks for the most important events.
It is visually attractive, but the colors and
sizes of the different elements don't really mean anything. And the
whole bottom left part of the chart is only meant to show some sense
of humor. You can click on the thumbnail below to see the full image.
</p>

  <img src="/images/michael-anderson-resume-infographics.jpg"
       alt="Infographic resume of Michael Anderson" />
</a>

<p>
<strong>Christoper Perkins</strong> designed another resume using the
common look of a subway map. Also it is visually original, but the
connections between the different elements are not very complex
(only two intersections between lines), so using the look
of a subway map seems to add more complexity that it removes.
Also this visualization uses intersections between lines to represent
the fact that two events happened at the same point in time. But the
fact that two work projects or education courses happened at the same
time is probably not the most important characteristic
of a resume.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Compare this use of the subway visualization with the Map of Rock of
<strong>Ernesto Lago</strong>. Here what is important is how some
musicians merge two different styles, or inherit from two different
musical schools or traditions, and that is exactly what the subway
intersections represent.
</p>

</a>

<p>
<strong>Greg Dizzia</strong> gives a different point of view. In his
resume he adds the skills involved in each professional project.
I think this is very valuable to potential employers, and it's one
of the main points of a resume. In this case I think the visualization
is a little bit too charged and repetitive but the main message
is very well expressed.
</p>

       alt="Infographic resume of Greg Dizzia"/>
</a>

<p>
As a last example let's take a look at the resume of
<strong>Gabriele Bozzi</strong>. In this case he forgets almost
completely about the temporal element of the resume and concentrates
on the functional areas. And he divides them between general skills,
and knowledge of particular applications and tools. To me this
has too much detail, and way too much <em>keyword hunting</em>, but
the visual display is very interesting.

<h3>How to Make an Infographic Resume yourself</h3>

<p>
First of all, just like any other infographic project we need to
decide what data we are going to show. In my case I will take short
snippets of projects in which I have worked on. Because the main point
of this post is to show how to develop the visual component I won't
spend too much time in getting a great wording of each project,
or using the correct keywords.
</p>

<p>
Second, it's necessary to decide what is the most important messages
that we want to convey from that data. In my case these messages are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Education</strong>:
    I have a thorough education in Computer Science and Mathematics.
    It is not too varied because I don't have courses or
    certifications in other areas, and I studied all my degrees in the
    same University. But I have spent 10 years on it.
    Also, I don't want to add much detail about college projects,
    because they are less interesting than professional projects.
    And I don't want to mix education and work, because I combined
    both over the last few years and it would just look confusing
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Work</strong>:
    I have worked in some of the most prestigious companies in the
    world, in increasing degrees of responsibility and success and
    I definitely want to emphasize that.
    Also I want to mention that I worked in some particular areas
    in software, like machine learning. And I started doing a little
    bit of research lately. So I think it's worth showing that
    I am versatile, in terms of work skills.
    Finally I think it's also worth mentioning my contributions to
    open source and internships, because they add variety to my
    professional experience
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Impact</strong>:
    Finally, because I have been lucky to work in projects that
    are public and other people are using, I have had a significant
    impact outside of my employers. I want to emphasize that as well
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
And third, after the message is clear, it's turn to decide what kind of
visualization would fit best the data and the message. I won't go very
deep into this topic, because there is so much to talk about that
we could fill several books. So here are the decisions I took:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For the education I will simply show a bar with all the degrees
    that I have attained, in a straight line. The size of each part
    of the bar indicates how long it took to get that degree.
    The colors are only to differentiate sections. A legend at the
    bottom will indicate what is each section. Also as this is the
   weakest section, it will go at the end of the resume
  </li>
  <li>
    For the experience part, I will show a timeline of professional
    positions, and the main projects within those positions.
    I will add the logos of the corresponding companies
    on the left side. And for each project I will indicate the
    functional skills that I used. In order to keep it simple I will
    have only 5 main skills. Also to have space for all the
    positions, I will have a vertical timeline, instead of the most
    common horizontal one
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, the impact of my projects is probably the most
    differentiating characteristic of my resume, so I will put it on
    top. And in order to show data that is easy to check I will use
    as a measure of impact the number of search results in google.com
    for the project name, divided by the number of developers in the
    project. In order to indicate which project corresponds to
    which value in the graph I will use an annotated time series.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
And without any more delay, here is the result!
</p>

<h3>

      data.setValue(7, 3, '<em>Tech Lead</em>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fetch+as+googlebot">Fetch as Googlebot</a><br/>(65K / 1)');

      var annotatedtimeline = new google.visualization.AnnotatedTimeLine(
          document.getElementById('visualization1'));
      annotatedtimeline.draw(data,
         {'displayAnnotations': true, 'max': 70000, 'allowHtml': true});
    }
    
    google.setOnLoadCallback(drawVisualization1);
  </script>

<p>
  <div id="visualization1" style="position: relative; left: -30px; width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>
</p>

<p>
Clicking in each one of the marks in the time series highlights
the description of the project. For each case I have included
the employer, the position and a very short description of the
project. In parentheses is the number of search results divided
by the number of people that worked in the project. Also clicking
in the description takes to a search results page. The results are
usually a reference my personal work, or work in which I participated.

    }

    google.setOnLoadCallback(drawVisualization2);
  </script>

<p>
  <div id="visualization2" style="position: relative; left: -30px;"></div>
</p>

<p>
In the experience table I have added basically the same projects
as above, but I have classified them by the main area of expertise.
The link in each one of the projects point to search results, exactly
the same way as before. It would have been also a good idea
to point to a short description of the project.
Initially I though about using color codes to indicate each main area
of expertise, but this would add a little bit of duplication, because
that is exactly what the columns mean. I think it is cleaner and more
understandable without color coding the skills.
</p>

<h3>
Education
</h3>

<img src="/images/javier-tordable-education.png"
       alt="Education of Javier Tordable"/>

<p>
And finally, the education section.
Here I decided to do a static image. The interactivity of the other
visualizations wouldn't add anything. Also I used a similar color
palette to the previous visualizations. Even though as it is there is
no relationship with the visualizations above, I could have explored
this idea further. Also I didn't add the university to avoid repeating
the name four times.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
To finish the post, I will repeat the core principles of how to make
a good visualization:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Collect the data to display, make sure its complete and precise
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide what is the most important message that you want to
    express
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose visualizations that convey that message but respect the data
  </li>
</ol>
