title: MIT Talk: Mathematics at Google

<p>
  A few weeks ago I gave a small webinar for a group of students from
  <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>.

  They told me it went quite well. About 40 people attended.

  I basically covered the material in this presentation about
  <a href="http://www.javiertordable.com/blog/2012/08/24/mathematics-at-google">
    Mathematics at Google</a>
  which I published last year.

  So I'll make use of the opportunity to put the link out there again,
  for any of you who didn't have the chance to take a look before. Comments
  and suggestions will be appreciated.
