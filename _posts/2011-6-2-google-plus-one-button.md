title: The Google +1 button
---

<p>
Google just made the +1 button available for websites.
The <a href="http://www.google.com/+1/button/">+1 button</a> is a
gadget that allows people to recommend content on the web.
</p>

<p>It's useful
for you because your friends will see your recommendations when they
do a related Google search. And it's great for sites because it gives
them the chance to see what items people like most. Now any site can
<a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/">
  add the +1 button following these instructions</a>. And you should
also check out the video to see all the cool features of the +1 button.
