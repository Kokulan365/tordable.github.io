I haven't done any kind of 3D design in many years, but I was thinking
last week that it would be fun to get back to it. And while I was looking
at software available for Linux, I found
<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.

Blender has been around for
<a href="http://www.blender.org/foundation/history/">quite some time</a>
but it seems that now it's <a href="http://www.blender.org/features/">
  features</a> are up to par with some of the most popular 3D packages
like 3DS Max or Alias.

Apart from the 3D design tools Blender has one very cool feature, a
<a href="http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_64_release/info_quickstart.html">Python API!</a> I will post another note after I have the
