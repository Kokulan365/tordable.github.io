title: Machine Learning at Stanford
---

<p>
This quarter I am leading a study group in Machine Learning at
Google's Kirkland Office. And while I was looking for datasets and
resources I found
<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/">Andrew Ng's</a> course
in Machine Learning at Stanford.
All the lectures are available online at YouTube. You can find the
links in the
<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/lecturelist.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1">
  Stanford Engineering Everywhere Machine Learning course page</a>.

Here is the first class of the series:
