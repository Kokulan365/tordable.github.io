Just a quick pointer to a book that I am reading right now,
<strong>Quantitative Ponzinomics</strong>, an essential guide to
understand what is going on currently in the financial markets around the world.

It's not a real book, but you should really check out the source,
the financial blog <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com">Zero Hedge</a>.
And in order to keep this blog on-topic, here is an interesting link
about <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/High-Frequency_Trading_(HFT)">
  High Frequency Trading</a>, which is an automated procedure to
make financial transactions using computer algorithms to get an
advantage over other investors.
