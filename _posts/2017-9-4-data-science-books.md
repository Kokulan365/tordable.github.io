Data science is a discipline that uses scientific methods, statistics, computer science and business management in order
to solve business problems using data. Recently it has become incredibly popular, thanks to the multitude of
open source frameworks, cheaper compute resources and especially the increase in the
amount of data that is being generated and captured. Data science can be applied to a variety of areas,
but its biggest impact recently has been in the context of business analytics and decision processes.

It is not accident that data scientist is one of the most sought after jobs, and one of the better paid positions. 
See for example the following report by [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm).
