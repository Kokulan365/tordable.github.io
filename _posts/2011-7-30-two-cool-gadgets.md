title: Two Cool Gadgets

<p>
Just wanted to leave a note on two new cool gadgets that I found online.

The first one is a homemade
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope">
  electron microscope</a>. An electron microscope is a type of microscope
that uses electrons instead of regular light to illuminate and create
images with better resolution. Kudos to
<a href="http://benkrasnow.blogspot.com/2011/03/diy-scanning-electron-microscope.html">
  Ben Krasnow</a> for it.

<p>
The second one is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">
  3D printer</a> that can be used to print biological organs.
<a href="http://www.organovo.com/">Organovo</a> has figured out how to
use 3D rapid prototyping to print blood vessels. But who knows if in
the future they will be able to print full organs?
