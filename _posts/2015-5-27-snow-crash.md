title: Snow Crash

I can't believe I didn't read Snow Crash until now. Snow Crash is a novel by Neal Stephenson in which he introduced the [Metaverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse). What we would call today a virtual reality world. While I was reading it, I had to remind myself that the book was published in 1992. More than 10 years ahead of [Second Life](http://secondlife.com) and WOW.

Today, we are in the initial stages of a new generation of virtual reality. Next year we will see the launch of [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/), and [Project Morpheus](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/ps4/features/project-morpheus/)!
