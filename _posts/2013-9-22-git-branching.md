<p>
I haven't had much time to write lately, work is keeping me busy. But today
I wanted to share a site I found recently and I think is really interesting.
It's essentially a git tutorial, but with a twist.

As most of you know <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> is a version control
system. Essentially, a program to track and coordinate updates to a set of
files, which is one of the most basic tasks in software engineering.
<a href="http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/">Learn Git Branching</a>
helps beginners learn how to use git. But instead of simply explaining the
git commands it's structured as a puzle game. The levels are git tree
structures, and in order to solve the puzzles it's necessary to input the
proper git commands.

The puzzles go from the very simple, to the fairly complex. So even if you
already know git, it may be fun to play the most advanced levels.
