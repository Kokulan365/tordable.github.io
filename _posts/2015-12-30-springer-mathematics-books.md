Springer, the academic publisher, has been maintaining an open access program for a while. They have released thousands of books in their website, free to download. Apparently it's been going on for a while but I only found out recently.

Looking at the [catalog](http://www.springeropen.com/books), the selection is great. It includes hundreds of books from the _Graduate Text in Mathematics_ series. In particular some of the books that I used in University. For example [Lang's Algebra](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4613-0041-0)

All the books in the open access catalog seem to be published on 2004 or before. I encourage you to browse through the [catalog here](http://www.springeropen.com/books).
