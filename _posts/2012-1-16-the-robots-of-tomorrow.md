title: The Robots of Tomorrow
---

<p>
I've been reading a little bit lately about robots. It's amazing how
fast robotics has advanced in the last ten years. On the one hand we
have several million robots doing useful tasks in people's homes.
I'm talking of course about the
<a href="http://www.irobot.com/">Roomba</a>.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand we have projects that are pushing the boundaries
of what is possible to automate. For example the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_car">
  Google driverless car</a>,
which has recorded thousands of miles of automatic driving in a variety
of road environments.

<p>
There is also an increasing trend of automation in factories.
Of course robots have been used in manufacturing for quite a while,
but in the near future it may be possible to replace complete
categories of human workers (See
<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-07/30/c_131018764.htm">this</a>
or
<a href="http://singularityhub.com/2011/12/09/a-drop-in-solution-for-replacing-human-labor-kawadas-nextage-robot/">this</a>).
</p>

<p>
But from my point of view the most important advance is the creation
of platforms that other engineers can build upon. On the hardware side,
I specially like the
<a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview">
  Willow Garage PR2</a>.
</p>

<p>
The PR2 is a very complete hardware platform, with many features
for movement, manipulation of objects, cameras and other sorts of
sensors. Although the PR2 is still very expensive (400,000 $ for the
complete version) I imagine having a solid and reliable hardware
platform would allow robotics teams to concentrate on the automation
of behavior, which is the really important part.
</p>

<p>
On the software side, I think <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/">ROS</a>
(Robot Operating System) is a good step in the creation of a platform.
It already has a very large set of
<a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/StackList">modules available</a>
for all sorts of robot behavior.
</p>

<p>
The same way that the IBM PC for example contributed to a new wave of
computing applications that dramatically changed the world that we live
in, we may find that in the next few years the PR2, ROS and their
successors have similar effects. I'm really excited to see what
robotics will bring us during this decade.
