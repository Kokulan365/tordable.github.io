title: The Modern Quest for Immortality
---


<p>
Human interest in the possibility of rejuvenation begins in
ancient times. Around 200BC the Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang became
obsessed with his own mortality and sent the famous alchemist Xu Fu to
find the Peng Lai islands (where immortal beings were believed to
live) and return with the elixir of life. Starting in the
Middle Ages, European alchemists began a quest for a substance that
was not only able to transform metal into gold, but also rejuvenate
whoever held it: the philosopher's stone. These myths have reached
the present day, and feature in works such as J. K. Rowling's (hugely
successful)
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher's_Stone">
first Harry Potter novel</a>.
</p>

<p>
Such contemporary references indicate we are still as fascinated by
the myth as our ancestors, but we might be evolving to a scenario
where what was once transcendental and restricted to the realm of the
imagination is likely to become very much real and palpable.
In part thanks to the work of Dr. Aubre de Grey and
<a href="http://sens.org/">SENS</a>.

<h3>Aubrey de Grey</h3>

<p>
Aubre de Grey is one of the most prominent faces of the longevity
movement, and somewhat of a celebrity within scientific circles.
Although he came from a computer science background, Dr. de
Grey's interest in aging research was already well developed as early
as 1999, when he published a book analyzing the role of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a>
in aging, a book which granted him his Cambridge PhD, even though
he had not enrolled for doctoral studies. This interest in aging
research quickly became focused on regenerative medicine (or
biogerontology) and in the early years of the new millennium several
conferences of like-minded individuals paved the way to a plan to cure
aging, which they called SENS.

<h3>SENS</h3>

<p>
SENS is an acronym for Strategies for Engineered Negligible
Senescence. Despite the daunting name, the ultimate goal of this
approach is simply to reach a level of
technological advancement where we have such knowledge and control
over the human body's biological machinery that we are able to
diagnose and repair whatever goes wrong. Although, admittedly, this
kind of development is bound to be decades or even centuries away,
that does not mean people alive today might not see their life
extended. As Dr. de Grey
elegantly explains in this TED talk (included below),
we don't need to solve the entire aging problem
within a small time frame, but we will extend our lifespan in
successive increments as research progresses and we uncover new ways
to rejuvenate our bodies. Of course, in the time between discoveries
we will continue to age, but as long as the speed at which new
developments reach the market is greater than the rate at which
biological damage takes place, we will have
attained
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_escape_velocity"> actuarial
escape velocity</a> and, consequently, the possibility to live for a
very long time, and eventually immortality.
</p>

<h3>How SENS will help us live longer</h3>

<p>
In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312367074/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=javitordblogo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399377&creativeASIN=0312367074">
Ending Aging</a> </em>(a very engaging and surprisingly easy to read book),
Dr. de Grey explains what he considers to be the seven factors behind
aging and the <a href="http://www.sens.org/sens-research/research-themes">SENS
approaches designed to tackle </a>them. Very briefly, these are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>RepleniSENS - Cellular loss or atrophy</li>
	<li>OncoSENS - Mutations that lead to cancer
	and changes in the proteins that are around DNA</li>
	<li>ApoptoSENS - Cells which can no longer divide
	but refuse to die</li>
	<li>MitoSENS - Mutations in mitochondria</li>
	<li>LysoSENS - Junk that gets accumulated inside
	the cells</li>
	<li>AmyloSENS - Junk that gets accumulated outside
	the cells</li>
	<li>GlycoSENS - Random links that cells make and
	cause tissue to lose its elasticity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Even if the problems have been identified, we are still not at a
point where we can make great strides in all areas. What SENS has been
doing, however, is a number of strategic advances in areas which have
great relevance now and whose potential benefits are enormous, for example:
</p>

<p>
<strong>RepleniSENS</strong> is one of those areas. The program seeks 
to solve the problem created by cells which divide slower than they die.
This cellular behavior is behind many of the
age-related pathologies, including loss of muscle strength (due simply
to the decrease of the number of muscle cells) or Parkinson's
disease. However,
<a href="http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/about_us/news/news_items/all_news/stem_cells_through_the_nose.aspx">
a group of German researchers</a> working under the SENS umbrella
discovered a way to
administer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell">stem
cells</a> to rats' brains in a non-invasive fashion through the
nose. The rats, which exhibited symptoms of Parkinson's, showed great
improvement in mobility after receiving the treatment.
</p>

<p>
Another very exciting field is the one under <strong>AmyloSENS</strong>. This
approach intends to (literally) clean up the junk that accumulates
outside the cells either by stimulating the immune system to find and
eat it or by introducing enzymes (the agents that do the eating)
directly into the body. Dr. Houk and his research team have been
undertaking the Herculean task of
<a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/designer-enzymes-created-by-ucla-46985.aspx">
using computer simulation to design enzymes from scratch</a>, so they can be
very effective at removing each different type of accumulated
junk.

<h3>Controversy</h3>

<p>
Even today, the outlook for the SENS project is not clear. In November,
<a href="http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v6/n11/full/7400555.html">
a group of 28 biogerontologists released a response</a> to a paper by de
Grey accusing him of being overly
optimistic by claiming that each one of the specific proposals
that comprise the SENS agenda is exceptionally optimistic,
and went as far as stating that a
program as speculative as SENS did not deserve the respect of the
scientific community. Previously, de Grey sparked the controversy with a paper
that he wrote in the MIT Technology review
<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/">
MIT Technology review</a> offering a reward
to whoever could prove that the idea of
SENS was so preposterous that it was not even worthy of scholarly
debate. Although 5 submissions were
received, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/">independent
juries analyzed them</a> and concluded they did not provide compelling
evidence to warrant the dismissal of the SENS approach, although they
recognized the speculative nature of the programme.
</p>

<h3>Other research projects</h3>

<p>
It could be said that other scientists
are taking the research step-by-step, whereas SENS is looking at what
lies ahead, but the immediate research concerns are not conceptually
different. In fact, much exciting research in biogerontology is being
done around the world. For instance,
<a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/11/the-curious-case-of-the-backward.html?ref=hp">
Harvard researchers</a> took mice
whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase">telomerase
enzyme</a> was shut down and consequently developed symptoms of aging
very soon (having a very short life-span) and reactivated the
enzyme. Almost instantly, the mice became healthy, with recovery being
almost total. These are encouraging results not only because they
indicate rehabilitation is likely to be possible even if treatment
starts in adulthood, but also because it offers great promise in
treating accelerated aging diseases
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progeria">progeria</a>. Similarly, a
<a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/07/08-01.html?ref=hp">
collaboration between 3 American universities</a> uncovered that rapamycin, a
drug that has been used to prevent organ rejection and to treat tumors, was
able to extend the life-span of mice between 5 and 16%. What was most
surprising about this result, however, is that the effect was achieved
with middle-aged mice. They started administering the
drug to mice at an age equivalent to 60 human years which leads credence
to Dr. de Grey's belief we might yet live to see significant
life-extension possibilities available.
</p>

<h3>The ethical debate on immortality</h3>

<p>
Part of the reason why SENS became so controversial recently
was <a href="http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v6/n1s/full/7400435.html">the
whole new ethical debate it brought about</a> immortality (or at
least a much longer life) was no longer a theoretical concept, but it
was possible to envision how it might become real. From one side of
the barricade, individuals against this type of life-extension claimed
death was natural and it would be a corruption of the natural order of
things (including evolution) to thwart death. Moreover, they were
concerned that social inequalities might become more pronounced as
these technologies would be used by rich people in detriment of the
poorer classes. On the other hand, transhumanists see nothing of
natural in dying (in fact, they go as far as considering death an
abomination) and find it unethical not to do anything in our power to
fight it. They also argue social inequalities would not be an issue as
society would adjust to the new paradigm as we have adjusted in the
past.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of where you stand in this debate, one thing appears
clear research on the matter, either cautiously or overtly
optimistic, is happening and we are finally starting to get a glimpse
of how the extremely complex machinery within our bodies
works. Whether that research will be applied only time will tell but,
who knows, some of us might live to celebrate the year 3000 :)
