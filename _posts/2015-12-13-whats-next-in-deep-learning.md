title: What's Next in Deep Learning
---


[Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) is one of the world's top experts in Machine Learning, and had a tremendous influence making Deep Learning a popular technique for problems in speech recognition, image captioning and many others. In particular, he was one of the founders of the [Google Brain](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html) group a few years ago.

This talk during the 2015 GPU Technology conference is a few months old, but still very relevant to what's happening right now in Deep Learning. Andrew also touches on one of the critical issues raised by advances in ML, the automation of the workforce. I hope you enjoy it.
