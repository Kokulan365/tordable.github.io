title: My First Blog Post
---


Hello everybody. This is the first post in my new blog. This is not your common Wordpress or Blogger blog. It runs on a custom blogging platform made from scratch, on top of Google App Engine. Soon I will add a couple of posts about how it's done, and I will release the code of the platform.


<p>
In the future I will use this blog to talk about stuff that interests me. For example:
<ul>
  <li>Google App Engine, Django and other tools for rapid web application development</li>
  <li>Sage, an open source mathematics package</li>
  <li>Devi Prasad Shetty, and how he transformed medicine through mass production</li>
  <li>Interesting visualizations! As information is more and more available it is becoming increasingly important how to visualize and understand easily</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The subscribe links don't work yet, so I am afraid you won't be able to read this blog in your favorite RSS reader. But I hope that I will see you again soon. Thanks for coming!
</p>

Update (1/13/2015): Not really.
