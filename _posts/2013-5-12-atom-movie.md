  IBM researchers</a> used the scanning tunneling
microscope to control a super-sharp needle along a copper surface to “feel” atoms. Only 1 nanometer away from the
surface, which is a billionth of a meter in distance, the
needle can physically attract atoms and molecules on the
surface and thus pull them to a precisely specified location
on the surface.
