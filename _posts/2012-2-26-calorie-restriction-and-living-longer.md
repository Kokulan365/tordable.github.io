title: Calorie Restriction and Living Longer
---

<p>
During the 20th century the life expectancy grew from an average of 47 years to about 70-80 years, in part because of improved healthcare and hygiene as well as the development of antibiotics and vaccines. In some places even greater incidence of extraordinary life spans has even been observed, like the Japanese from Okinawa, who have the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/12/02/okinawa.aging/index.html">highest number of centenaries in the world</a>.

.







<p>
This cannot be explained by the same improvements that led to the extension of life expectancy elsewhere in the world. The quest to unveil the reasons behind their increased longevity has captured the mind of biogerontologists, who have spent decades investigating the causes, mechanisms and consequences of aging. <a href="http://www.javiertordable.com/modern-quest-for-immortality/">Dr. Aubrey de Grey</a>, the leader of the strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS) foundation, suggests that

Today, with the help of modern medicine and science, researchers have been making great progress in understanding how the aging process works and how we can control or even reverse it to some extent. The SENS foundation (and its affiliated researchers) has been pivotal to this effort, being involved in bringing innovation such
as <a href="http://sens.org/sens-research/extra-mural/projects/immunorejuvenation-at-arizona">rejuvenating
the immune system to better fight disease</a> in later years or
<a href="http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/about_us/news/news_items/all_news/stem_cells_through_the_nose.aspx">using
   stem cells to treat Parkinson's disease</a>. Other unaffiliated
biogerontologists have also made remarkable advancements like the
development of a
<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111207113552.htm">drug
   that might reverse aging-related decline of the brain.</a>

<p>
While these new techniques and breakthroughs are very exciting, we are
still at least a few decades away from seeing practical applications.
However, there are two lifestyle factors which can have a remarkable
effect on how we age, and are well within our control: exercise and
diet. Exercise is a good strategy to stave off <em>secondary</em> aging
(aging that comes as a consequence of disease), as it can be seen by its
effect on
the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111004221112.htm">
health of people suffering from kidney disease</a> or in
the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110815095727.htm">
  prevention of damage linked to Alzheimer's disease</a>.
A good diet can not only have benefits when it comes to <em>secondary</em>
aging, but it can even extend the maximum life span slowing down
<em>primary</em> (disease independent) aging.
</p>

<h3>Diet and life extension</h3>

<p>
When it comes to diet, attention tends to be immediately drawn to
healthy eating (something that nutritionists have been advocating for
decades) as the ultimate goal, but even more can be potentially
accomplished with dietary change. A very successful strategy for
increasing life span is, in fact,
<a href="http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2001/11/calorie-restriction-explained.php">calorie restriction</a>.
Something as
simple as reducing the amount of energy we obtain from food beyond the
recommended daily intake levels, while ensuring that the diet still
includes enough nutrients.

<p>
Although this idea might seem counter-intuitive, eating less may make
it possible to live longer. Several
 <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/07/09-01.html">
studies conducted on animals</a> prove that. In particular, studies on
mice reveal a very interesting trend. Individuals which had a diet
with the full recommended daily dosage of nutrients but with calorie
restriction lived longer if they started on a calorie restricted diet
early, just after their growing period. In fact, such a strategy
extended life up to an incredible 80% in young animals and still
provided a 20-30% increase in lifespan of animals which were already
middle-aged by the time their diet was changed. Still, the benefits
did not stop there, not only did the animals live longer, but they
were healthy throughout the course of their lives. In Rhesus monkeys
(who share more in common with humans than rats), long-term studies
are now being carried out and preliminary reports (at a stage where
monkeys have reached their average life expectancy) point to a
three-fold difference in deaths due to age-related illness between a
calorie restricted group and monkeys fed a regular diet.

<h3>How calorie restriction works</h3>

<p>
Our bodies accumulate energy in the form of a reusable molecule,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">ATP</a>. Every
time we breathe, move or even think we use ATP, which then needs to be
recharged. That happens in specific sites in our cells,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria">mitochondria</a>,
which are structures akin to power stations, where a number of
complex reactions (which depend on the presence of oxygen) spring life
back into the ATP molecule in a never ending cycle. However, sometimes
that operation malfunctions and the oxygen we breathe (which is
essential for the whole process) is affected in an undesirable
fashion, creating damaging molecules which would cause havoc if left
to roam free. To stop these molecules our cells have mechanisms
designed to neutralize them, a task at which they are fairly
effective during youth (although damage often starts decades before
any symptoms are evident). But they become less and less so as the years go
by, when damage progressively becomes rampant.

<p>
This accumulated damage is likely to be behind the cellular
"garbage" which causes Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease; chronic
inflammation responsible for rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis;
changes in lipid metabolism, which lead to type 2 diabetes and muscle
loss; and many other diseases which tend to lead to premature
death. Calorie restriction has been shown to reduce the rate at which
all these different types of damage occur and, while the exact
molecular mechanisms are not yet clear, is likely to do so on two
fronts. First, by increasing the efficiency of the mechanisms that prevent
damaging oxygen molecules from having detrimental effects. Second, by
reducing the amount of damaging oxygen molecules from the start.
In addition, it is hypothesized calorie
restriction might reduce the metabolic rate itself. This would be in
line with the observation that calorie restricted animals tend to have
lower body temperature, but further research on the subject is still
needed.
</p>

<h3>You can live longer too</h3>

<p>
Human trials conducted so far support the hypothesis that calorie
restriction is a valid and useful method in
<a href="http://www.javiertordable.com/blog/2010/01/15/trascend-book-kurzweil-grossman">
  extending life span</a>.
 Despite the relatively short duration of the experiments,
several studies show calorie restriction has the ability to reduce the
effects of secondary aging
(for example by <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100723112715.htm">starving
cancer</a>
or <a href="http://www.ecardiologynews.com/specialty-focus/hypertension/single-article-page/diabetes-calorie-restriction-yields-lasting-cardiac-benefit.html">
reducing the severity of diabetes and cardiovascular disease</a>) and even
to <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060531164818.htm">slow
down primary aging</a>, thus extending the maximum lifespan an
individual could hope for. In addition, populations which endured
food shortages are known to have lived longer and healthier lives. The
Okinawan example is, once again, of great relevance. This
population had an impoverished diet during world war II which,
combined with
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_diet">naturally
calorie restricted diet</a>, has made it possible for individuals who
were adult when the war broke to be alive today. Although genetic
factors may also be in play, the fact younger Okinawans who opted for
an approximation to a Western diet are facing much lower life
expectancy is a strong indicator calorie restriction was at least
partly responsible for the beneficial effects observed.

<p>
Nevertheless, there are some hazards to this approach. Calorie restriction
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction#Not_for_the_young.2C_or_those_with_low_body_fat">
not suitable for children and teenagers</a>, who are in a particular
phase of development which requires large energy intake. There is
risk of stunted growth and cognitive dysfunction. On the other
end of the spectrum, the fact that calorie restriction is correlated
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction#Musculoskeletal_losses">
moderate loss of bone and muscle mass</a> exposes the elderly to a potentially
larger danger of bone fractures and loss of mobility. Moreover,
even on healthy adults this is a strategy which requires significant
attention, as particular care is needed to ensure the nutritional
needs are consistently met and the energy intake is not too low, since
such behaviour effectively consists of starvation.
This is very undesirable because it is the percursor of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_response">plethora of
metabolic changes</a> leading up to further muscle mass loss as well
as hormonal imbalance and increased cellular stress levels, therefore
cancelling out all the positive effects of calorie restriction.
