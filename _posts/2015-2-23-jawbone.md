The last few months I’ve been using a [Jawbone](http://www.jawbone.com) tracker. It’s a small bracelet which keeps track of steps and sleep patterns. And it’s been very useful to help me sleep a bit longer. From what I understand most people don’t get enough sleep, so I recommend checking it out. A while back I achieved a nice milestone. A thousand hours of sleep and one million steps.

One thousand hours of sleep.

And one million steps.
