title: Collaborative Mathematics and The Future of Science
---

<p>
Mathematical research is traditionally seen as a one-man job. To quote
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lQosnIw05dYC">
  Jean Dieudonn in The Music of Reason</a>:
</p>


> Research in the experimental sciences is done in laboratories, where
> larger and larger teams are needed to manipulate the instruments and to
> scrutinize the results. To do research in mathematics nothing is needed
> except paper and a good library. Team-work, as practiced in the
> experimental sciences is, then, quite unusual in mathematics, most
> mathematicians finding it difficult to think seriously except in silence
> and solitude. Collaborative work, while quite common, most often
> consists in putting together results that each of the collaborators
> has managed to obtain in isolation, albeit with mutual profit from
> each other's ideas, enabling them to progress form new points of
> departure.

In spite of that, about a year ago
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers">Tim Gowers</a>
asked himself if it would be possible to solve important mathematical
problems by collaborating openly over the internet. Not a collaboration
among a few colleagues, but among everybody that had any insight about
the problems. He shared this question with the mathematical community
through a
<a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/">
  post in his blog</a>.
That was the birth of the
<a href="http://polymathprojects.org/">Polymath</a> project.
</p>


<p>
The first problem that the Polymath group worked on is the attempt to
obtain a simple proof for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HalesJewett_theorem">
  HalesJewett theorem</a>. This theorem is a very important result
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory">
  Ramsey theory</a>. In very gross terms Ramsey theory says that
for many mathematical structures, there is no such thing as complete
randomness.
</p>


<p>
For example, take a group of six people: Alice, Bob, Charles, David,
Erin and Fritz. The Ramsey theorem tells us that there are either 3
people that all know each other, or 3 people that are all strangers to
each other. Even in something as random as a party, if there are
at least 6 people then we can find a very special subgroup of 3 people.
</p>


<p>
Here is the proof: Take Alice, imagine that she knows less than 3 people at the party. That is, she knows only Bob, or knows only
Bob and Charles. Then we consider David, Erin and Fritz. If they all
know each other, we have a group of 3 people that know each other.
If not, two of them don't know each other, for example David doesn't
know Erin. As a consequence Alice, David and Erin are all strangers
to each other.
If Alice knows 3 people or more, the proof is the same, say she knows
Bob, Charles and David. If none of them knows each other then there we
have our group of 3 strangers. But if two of them know each other, for
example Bob knows Charles, the group Alice, Bob and Charles all know
each other.
</p>

<p>
So far the Polymath group has discussed 5 problems, which are all
shown in the
<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Main_Page"wiki>
  Wiki</a>
and they have started to publish some of the results. Here is link to
a paper from D.H.J. Polymath on arXiv,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3926">
  A new proof of the density Hales-Jewett theorem</a>.

The following image is a part of a 3D Maldelbrot
fractal, as described
<a href="http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/mandelbulb.html">
  here</a>.
It has nothing to do with the rest of the post, but the Hales-Jewett
theorem doesn't lend itself easily to fancy pictures.

And for comparison purposes this is a piece of romanesco broccoli.

Of course, Mathematics is not the only scientific discipline in which
people collaborate openly in interesting problems. Michael Nielsen has
a great blog
<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/doing-science-online/">
  post</a> about doing science online. Probably the most important point
is that the way that scientists work with each other is changing.
And the change is driven mostly by new online collaboration tools. To
finish the post I will quote Michael:
