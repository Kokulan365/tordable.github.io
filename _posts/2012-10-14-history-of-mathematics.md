Today I would like to share a

  Youtube video course on the History of Mathematics</a>.
I haven't watched all of it, but I liked the part that I saw.

It was written by some of the best Russian Mathematicians of the last
century. It covers most major branches of Mathematics and it's written
in a very accessible style. When I read it I became fascinated
by the sheer beauty and incredible variety of Mathematics.
I'm very happy to see that Dover published a new edition
recently. If you have any interest in Mathematics,
I would highly recommend that you take a look at it.
