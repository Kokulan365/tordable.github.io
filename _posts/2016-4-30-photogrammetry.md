title: Photogrammetry
---

The Astronauts, the team behind [The Vanishing of Ethan Carter](http://ethancartergame.com), just published a great summary of how they are using photogrammetry in order to create some of the [most realistic 3D scenes ever seen in a game](http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/).

I worked in a photogrammetry project while I was in university, for the [LFA-DAVAP](http://157.88.193.21/~lfa-davap/) research group. [My second CS degree project](http://www.javiertordable.com/projects/) (similar to a Masters's project) was a tool to merge point clouds from laser scans with photographs in order to build a color 3D model.

It was great to read about how the was made. Now I also have a perfect excuse to spend time [playing it](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OA7OE3I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00OA7OE3I&linkCode=as2&tag=javitordblogo-20&linkId=MYCHVKLY3WS2JNAA).
