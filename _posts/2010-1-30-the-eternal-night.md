<p>
My brother David is a film director. He has been making short film for a few
years, he has even won a few prizes. Most of his work is at
<a href="http://www.tpmpictures.com">tpmpictures.com</a>. Today I just wanted to
show his last piece of work, a science fiction short about the end of the world.
The short is in Spanish but with English subtitles.

There are a couple of things that are interesting in this short. First, the
script is not wildly improbable. Check out this (humorous) list of the

the special effects are pretty nice for a zero budget short. If you liked it,
