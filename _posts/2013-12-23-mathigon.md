A while back I found a beautiful website on Mathematics and I wanted to
share the link: <a href="http://world.mathigon.org/">Mathigon</a> has a
series of introductory articles and many images, figures and interactive
visualizations on a variety of mathematical topics.
</p>

<a href="http://world.mathigon.org/">

The content is quite basic, but it's presented in a great way, the website
is well built, and the pictures are fantastic.
