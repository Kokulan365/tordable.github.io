<p>
I would like to share a quick note about some writing tools
that I've been using lately.
</p>


<p>
The first one is <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">
  iaWriter</a>. It's an iPad app with a focus on simplicity,
which enables concentrating in the text itself. It has
support for saving files in Dropbox,
 but considering the
<a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?#hl=en&q=dropbox+insecure">
  security problems that Dropbox has</a> I'd rather not use
it. I end up sending files to myself over email. The files
are just plain text files, with
<a href="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/markdown-syntax-reference-guide">
  Markdown syntax</a>.
</p>

<a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">

</a>

<p>
And there is where the second tool comes in.
<a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html">
  pandoc</a> allows converting the plain text Markdown
files into a wide variety of output formats. For example:
HTML (which I can then paste into the blog), LaTeX
(if I want to write a paper) or EPUB (so that I can publish
it later as an eBook). The chart below should give you an
idea of the many formats supported by pandoc.
</p>

</a>

<p>
Also, as a curiosity, pandoc is written in
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">
  Haskell</a>!. For those of you not familiar with Haskell
I recommend this

  post by Steve Yegge</a>.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there are many more editors that support
Markdown, as well as more powerful editing. However, I find
that I only need to do simple tasks on the iPad. For anything
that is more complicated, I prefer to use the computer.
And in that case the best editor that I know is, by far,
<a href="http://www.lyx.org/Home">Lyx</a>.

I hope some of these tools will be useful for you.
Or, if you have better recommendations, drop me a line on
