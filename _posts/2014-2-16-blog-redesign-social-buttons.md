title: Blog Redesign and Social Buttons
---


<p>
Hello, internets! I just redesigned the look & feel of the blog. The new
design has bigger font sizes and less distractions. It's optimized for
mobile so it should look much better than before on Android and iOS phones,
and especially on iPad.

Apart from the new sleek design now each post has multiple social buttons,
to +1 on Google Plus, Like on Facebook, tweet on Twitter and share on LinkedIn
to your heart's content. Check them out below.
