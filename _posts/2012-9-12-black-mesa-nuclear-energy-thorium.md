title: Black Mesa, Nuclear Energy and Thorium
---

<p>
I was recently in the Denver area, and while driving around I saw directions
to a place called Mesa. This reminded me of Black Mesa, which is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_Research_Facility#Black_Mesa_Research_Facility">
  location of the original Half Life game</a>.
The game actually starts after some kind of nuclear accident,
which opens an inter-dimensional portal.

Now in real life, Black Mesa holds simply a rocket testing center.
And nuclear accidents don't open inter-dimensional portals, but have other
kinds of

  consequences</a>.

<p>
To bring the discussion back on topic, I wanted to mention a great video
about an alternative form of nuclear power generation which has many
advantages over conventional methods. The alternative is

  Thorium-based nuclear power</a>.
