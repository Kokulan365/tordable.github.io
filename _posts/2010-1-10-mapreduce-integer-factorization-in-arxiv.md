title: MapReduce Integer Factorization in arXiv
---

<p>
This Monday I published my article on
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0421">MapReduce for integer factorization
  in arXiv</a>. The article is essentially the same that can be downloaded
in the <a href="/research">research</a> section of this site. So if you have
already checked it out, you won't find anything new. However I am very excited
because it is my first addition to arXiv.

<p>
In case that you are not familiar with
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org">arXiv</a>, it is one if the greatest scientific
sites in the web. It has over half a million articles, especially in the
fields of mathematics, physics and computer science, and many relevant papers
are published in the arXiv months before they appear in any peer reviewed
journal.
