> The Illustris project is a large cosmological simulation of galaxy formation,
> completed in late 2013, using a state of the art numerical code and a
> comprehensive physical model. Building on several years of effort by members
> of the collaboration, the Illustris simulation represents an unprecedented
> combination of high resolution, total volume, and physical fidelity.
