<p>
<a href="http://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> is finally here!
Google+ is the new social network from Google.
It has a lot of cool features that make it better than anything else
out there, like for example, the hangouts, which are like Skype, but with
many friends at the same time.

The look & feel of Google+ is very clean and it's easy to use after you
spend a few minutes getting familiar with the UI. And differently from
other social networks out there, you can download all your data whenever
you want.
