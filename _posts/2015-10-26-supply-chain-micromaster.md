title: Supply Chain Micromaster
---

Lately it's been "supply chain this" and "supply chain that" for me. So here is another blog post about Supply Chain! I've been studying for two online courses in EdX: I talked a bit about the [first course in a previous blog post](http://www.javiertordable.com/supply-chain/), and I just started the [second part](https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-design-mitx-ctl-sc2x).

Recently MIT made changes to the Supply Chain courses to establish a new type of degree. The MITx staff are calling it _Micromaster_, and it's supposed to be a more prestigious certification than the current verified course track in EdX.

I'm curious about whether we will see folks use these types of certifications on job applications in the future. In any case, it works great for me because I'm learning a lot about Supply Chain fundamentals, but without having to take a break from work for an on-site course.
