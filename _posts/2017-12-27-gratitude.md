2017 has been a year of many changes for me, big and small. New job, new house, new car, new TV. I got my feet wet with angel investing in tech startups, and also real estate investing. I traveled a lot. I went to Spain twice. I had a _trip of a lifetime_ to Machu Picchu, in Peru. I met old friends in Sweden and Romania. I dined at 4 of the top rated restaurants in the world, in Lima and New York. I met a group of incredibly talented entrepreneurs in Lithuania. I met some fantastic supply chain thought leaders at MIT, in Boston. And I've been very lucky to meet, and work with, colleages in the Office of the Cloud CTO. A true All-Star team, even in a place like Google.

Maybe one of the most imperceptible, but significant, changes is that I started recognizing all these great things that happened, and started feeling grateful for them. It's very easy to get annoyed by the problems that come up every day and forget sight of the big picture. However, I've found that spending a minute or two every day to meditate and be grateful has made me appreciate more what I have. And become more optimistic for 2018. To everybody that reads this blog, I hope you have a prosperious new year!
