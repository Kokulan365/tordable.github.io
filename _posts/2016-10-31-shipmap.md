This is one of the most interesting visualizations I have seen in a while. The folks at [Kiln](https://www.kiln.digital/) created a map of [merchant ships around the world](http://www.shipmap.org), including a breakdown of the contents of the ships, as well as CO2 emissions as a proxy for environmental impact. You can see a fully functioning version of the map below:

Of course shipping routes are critical for [Supply Chain](http://www.javiertordable.com/supply-chain/), which is what I've been doing lately. It's amazing to see the incredible number of containers that are traveling around the world every day!
