title: Masters of Doom

<p>
A few weeks ago I had the chance to read
<a href="http://74.220.215.94/~davidkus/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57">
  Masters of Doom</a> by David Kushner and found it very interesting.
It tells the story of John Carmack and John Romero, the founders of id Software
and authors of some the most revolutionary videogames ever.

The book includes the biographies of Carmack and Romero, as well
as plenty of anectodes of their wild ride in the world of videogames. But
the part that I found most interesting was the story of how Carmack became
such a talented (and widely acclaimed) software engineer. Highly recommended.
