I found out that Google is open sourcing (more or less) the build system used internally, Blaze. The open source version is called [Bazel](http://bazel.io).

This is one the key tools that allows Google engineers to keep most of the code in a single repository, with millions of cross references and still be productive. [Rachel Potvin and Josh Levenberg](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext) wrote a fantastic article explaining how this works in the Communications of the ACM. 

This is how Bazel files look like:

``` python
java_binary(
    name = "my-other-runner",
    srcs = ["src/main/java/com/example/ProjectRunner.java"],
    main_class = "com.example.ProjectRunner",
    deps = [":greeter"],
)

java_library(
    name = "greeter",
    srcs = ["src/main/java/com/example/Greeting.java"],
)
```

No XML, just BUILD artifacts described in clear syntax. The Github page with the source code is [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel).
