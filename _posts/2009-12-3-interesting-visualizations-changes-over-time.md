title: "Interesting Visualizations: Changes Over Time"
---

<p>
Visualizations are simply ways of representing data. But if they are good,
they can bring us deep insights, that go well beyond what is possible to
understand by simply looking at the raw data.
</p>
<p>
There are several categories of visualizations, for example:
  <ul>
    <li>Compare two entities based on a given set of metrics. An example
    of this is a benchmark between two competing companies or products</li>
    <li>Track the value of a given metric over time. A well known
    visualization of this type is a financial chart, with the value of an
    asset</li>
    <li>Compare the value of a single metric in different geographic locations.
    We have all seen maps in which the color of each region is based on the
    value of the metric</li>
  </ul>
<p>
Another very interesting set of visualizations are those that allow us to
track a particular situation over time. Here are three examples:

chart represent one kind of illness

Each color block is a movie, and the size represents the box office in each
week.

The first visualization doesn't attempt to indicate quantity because it
displays an abstract concept such as brand appreciation. However in the third
case the quantity is very concrete, the total box office in dollars.
</p>
<p>
We could use also the first or third approach for the second data set.
But if we went with the first kind of visualization most likely we would only
remember the most important expense for each age. Also we would be constrained
in the number of years to show. If we decided to go with a visualization of
the third kind it would be hard to compare how the expenses change relatively
to each other as all of them are likely to increase over time.
