<p>
  Welcome to the new sleek and minimalistic design of the
  blog!
</p>

<p>Take a look at the page source for the
  beautifully handcrafted HTML and CSS.
  Now with the option to include big images.
  For example, this completely
  unrelated picture of
  <a href="https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts">
    Project Glass</a>.
