Let's see how this works out. New blogging platform. Hello Ghost!

I really like the markdown editor of Ghost. It's very easy to add things like lists:

* One
* Two
* Three

And include code samples:

``` python
for i in range(10):
  print(i**2)
```

Which will make it easier for me to write frequently. But I suspect I will have to do a bit of customization here and there.
