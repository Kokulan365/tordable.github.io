<p>
Ive been a long time user of
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>.
It worked great for me until a few weeks ago, when I started noticing
it becoming slower. Also, I realized that many of the feeds that I
frequently read were updated less frequently that I wanted. And it will
only keep unread posts for up to 30 days. Anyway, my biggest issue with
Reader is that its a web based RSS aggregator. Which means that it can
be accessed from anywhere. Which really means that I may spend precious
time reading feeds while I should be doing more useful stuff (like
working...).

So I decided to find a good client-based RSS reader. After a little bit
of research I started using
<a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>,
which is the aggregator from the Mozilla Foundation (the same guys that
created <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a>).
And I have to say that I didnt like it at all. Not only its full of
counter intuitive options (why do I have to create a new folder for each
feed if I want to see them separately? and why when I add a new feed the
default option is to place posts in the same folder as the currently
selected feed?), but its really slow. To a point that it was painful to
read more than a few dozen posts straight.

After a little bit more research I ended up finding
<a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Akregator">Akregator</a>, which is made
by the same team that built the
<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE Desktop Environment</a>
for Linux. And so far I really like it! Its very fast, it allows to
open the actual website in a separate tab (as opposed to only the post) 
and it has great keyboard shortcuts (Alt+, Alt- to switch between unread
feeds, + and - to move between posts. No more tab back and forth to
switch feeds like in Thunderbird). My only complaint is that it doesnt
have an Undo Delete option.

So I settled with Akregator and I installed it on my home computer.
Since then, I am getting 30 minutes to an hour extra of work done every
day! The only thing that Im going to miss are the Google Reader
stats...
