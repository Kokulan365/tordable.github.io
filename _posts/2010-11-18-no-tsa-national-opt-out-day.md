title: Say No to the TSA. National Opt Out Day
---

<p>
This one if off topic, but I couldn't resist posting it. If you have traveled by air recently
you know about the porno-scanners. The TSA is forcing everyone to pass through the scanner or
be subject to a thorough pat-down. So they will either watch you naked or touch all your body,
including your private parts. And this includes you, your wife, your children and your grandma.
</p>


<p>
Fortunately, people have started to stand up against this outrageous invasion of privacy and
constitutional rights. Please check out <a href="http://wewontfly.com/">wewontfly.com</a>
and if you are traveling by air on November 24, opt out of the porno-scanner.
