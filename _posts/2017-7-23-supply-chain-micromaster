title: Supply Chain Micromaster
---

Two years and five online courses later I finished another degree: A Micromasters in Supply Chain.
This is very meaningful for me because the time studying Supply Chain has matched almost perfectly
the time that I was part of the Supply Chain team at Google. I was able to learn about the big
picture vision of Supply Chains as well as the details of the day to day in my team. I worked with
many others in order to build data centers and deploy compute capacity.

Next month I will attend another program in Supply Chain in person at MIT. But this time it will be
for slightly different reasons. I'm not as focused on operational efficiency at Google, but broader
industry knowledge, and how Supply Chains can be improved using information technologies, Cloud,
Big Data, IoT, etc. In a few days I'll post about my new and exciting role at Google!
