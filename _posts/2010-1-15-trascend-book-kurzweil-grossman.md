A couple of days ago I started reading
<a href="http://www.transcendbook.com/">TRANSCEND</a>, the new book from Ray
Kurzweil and Terry Grossman. The book starts from the principle that our
knowledge of medicine and biology is increasing to a point where we can start
to control effectively how fast our own bodies age. And even more important the
amount of knowledge that we gather is increasing over time. If the trend
continues we may reach a point where we can effectively reverse engineer our
bodies in order to avoid aging.

Whether you believe that we will reach that point or not, the book is an
interesting read. It is filled with healthy habits, complete diets and recipes,
exercise programs and more. Even if you leave aside the supplements and the
fancy biomedical technologies, there are plenty of actionable tips for
inproving your quality of life. For example to check for food intolerances.
There are millions of people out there that can't digest milk or wheat very
well and are not even aware of it.
