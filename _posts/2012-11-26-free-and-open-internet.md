title: A Free and Open Internet
---

<p>
On December 3rd, the worldâ€™s governments will meet to update a key treaty of
a UN agency called the
<a href="http://www.protectinternetfreedom.org/">
  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</a>.
Some governments are proposing to extend ITU authority to Internet governance
in ways that could threaten Internet openness and innovation, increase access
costs, and erode human rights online.
</p>

<p>
A free and open world depends on a
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/takeaction/whats-at-stake/">
  free and open Internet.</a>
Governments alone, working behind closed doors, should not direct its future.
The billions of people around the globe who use the Internet should have
a voice.
