title: Bye Google Reader, welcome Feedly
---

<p>
  Probably everyone that is reading this post knows that Google has decided
  to <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">
    discontinue Google Reader</a>.
  This comes as a surprise to many because of the large and very passionate
  user base, including myself.

  Fortunately, it seems there are quite a few companies offering alternatives
  and willing to pick up all the disheartened readers. I have been personally
  using <a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> for a few weeks now.

  While many of the other feed readers are merely frontends on top of the Google
  Reader backend, which is what keeps track of posts read and not read,
  <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/">Feedly
  promises to migrate all user data</a>
  to their backends when Google Reader closes. Apart from that, Feedly has a
  nice modern user interface, and works quite well on phones (iPhone and
  Android), tablets and Chrome. And it has very handy options to share pages
  on Twitter and Google+.

  It's been working quite well for me so far, so if you are looking for an
  alternative to Google Reader, I recommend that you give it a try.
